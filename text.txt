Hey there, I noticed we have a few things in common on our profiles. I see you like hiking, what's your favorite trail?

Oh cool, I've actually been wanting to try that one. Do you have any tips for someone who's never been before?

Nice, I'll definitely keep that in mind. So what do you do for work?

Wow, that sounds really interesting. I've always been fascinated by that field. What's your favorite part about it?

That's awesome. I actually work in a similar field, but in a different capacity. Do you enjoy working in a team or do you prefer working solo?

I totally get that. It's nice to have a balance of both. So what do you like to do for fun outside of work and hiking?
